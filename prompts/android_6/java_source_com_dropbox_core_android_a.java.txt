You are an expert in Android security analysis. Your goal is to analyze the code provided after the keyword "CODE:" and extract all URLs found within it.

Task Details:
- URL Extraction: Identify every URL present in the provided code.
- Request Detection: For each URL, determine if an HTTP request is being made:
 - - Use "true" if a request is being sent,
 - - "false" if no request is made,
 - - "null" if it is uncertain.
- Request Method: Specify the HTTP method used (e.g., GET, POST). If no request is made, leave this field as an empty string.
- Request Body: Provide details about the request body if applicable (or leave empty if not).
- Description: Include a brief explanation (maximum of three sentences) justifying your decisions regarding the request details.

Output Format:
Return your answer strictly as a JSON array of objects with the following structure. Do not include any extra text or commentary.
[
  {
    "url": "http://example.com",
    "is_request": true,
    "request_method": "GET",
    "request_body": "description of request body",
    "description": "brief description"
  }
]
